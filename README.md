# Text Editor 

## User Story
AS A developer<br>
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection<br>
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use<br>

## Installation

Simply click on the associated Heroku app, and click either the install button on the app, or in the install button in the window.
